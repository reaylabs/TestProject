2. Fixed bug where the scope time axis was displayed incorrectly when loading a previous file.
3. Allow the About Screen to be placed behind the main window.
4. Add the word External to the DC Load text box in the transient to make it clear that the value is for an external load.
5. Make the 0 horizontal scale for the Bode Gain And Phase and Impedance and Phase line up when in autoscale mode.
6. Make the Vout min and max lines in the transient be the same color of Vout sweep that is selected.
7. Modify the DC maximum power to the impedance measurement in the scope and impedance form. Maximum DC current probe DC power is limited to 12W.
8. Fix the LTsupplyAnalyzer typo in the Help file.
9. Register the .bod files in the Windows registry so the program can be launched by clicking on the .bod file icon.
10. Add the .bos setup file type that only contains the measurement setup and not the data.
11. Fixed bug that would sometimes show the bode plot cursors when a file was loaded that didn't have the cursors enabled.
12. Autoscale the Bode Plot and Impedance Plot during a measurement
13. Add the autolevel check box to the transient plot that allows the trigger level to be automatically calculated when checked and manually set when unchecked.
14. Shorten the time it takes to load a .bod file from disk.
15. Changing the designed switching frequency and tolerance in any of the measurements automatically updates the other measurements.
16. Add the Version History window to the Help menu.

18. Fixed a bug that sometimes crashed the program when aborting a bode plot in the slow mode and the frequency was low.
19. Fixed a bug that sometimes prevented the bode plot from triggering properly using the Analog Discovery 2.

Version 1.6.8.0
Date: 02-25-2021
Description:
1. Set the graphs for all measurements to default to autoscale mode. This allows the user to immediately take a measurement and view the results
   without adjusting the graph settings.
2. Changed the autoscale algorithm for the bode and impedance measurements to always show 0, and keep the axis labels to multiple of 5 or 10.
3. Changed the autoscale algorithm for scope and the transient measurement to always keep the data in the best vertical position for viewing.
4. The current trigger for the transient measurement is automatically set when the current levels are changed.
5. Fixed a bug in the bode plot aliased frequency detection algorithm that sometimes created a non-monotonic frequency value.
6. Fixed a bug in the scope that would cause the program to crash when the scope was stopped when waiting for a trigger.
7. Fixed a bug in the scope that would cause the program to crash when the scope time base range was changed when running.
7. Modify the switching frequency search algorithm to only search within the user selected tolerance around the design frequency value.
   If the switching frequency is not found, the aliased frequency avoidance algorithm is turned off. The wide-band frequency search was 
   eliminated because it was sometimes locking in on strong harmonics instead of the fundamental switching frequency. The algorithm now
   will now report 0 Hz on LDO's or switching supplies that have been turned off.
7. Add a more detailed explanation of the calibration procedure to the help file.
8. Update the help file with the new screen shots.
9. Add a section about the interface to LTpowerCAD in the help file.

Version 1.6.7.0
Date: 02-04-2021
Description:
1. Add the ability to handle multi-culture Windows settings without crashing.

Version 1.6.6.0
Date: 01-26-2021
Description:
1. Add the Scale Factor input for the transient Vout data. Simply multiplies the Vout+-Vout- measured voltage by the Scale Factor.
   Allows for a resistor divider placed at the Vout+ and Vout- inputs to extend range or account for gain errors.
2. Add the DC Load Current input to the transient load current to account for a parallel DC Electronic Load.
   Simply added the DC Load Current value to the measured load current values.
3. Automatically save the current setup when closing the program.
4. Add the ability to load the last setup from the FILE menu.

Version 1.6.5.0
Date: 01-17-2021
Description:
1. The switching frequency finder searches for a frequency close to the designed switching frequency. Previously, if it was not
   found, the value would be set to unknown. Now, if not found, a general search will be run, and the switching frequency will be
   set to the FFT frequency with the greatest magnitude.

Version 1.6.4.0
Date: 12-16-2020
Description:
1. Speed up the connection sense routine.
2. Speed up the scope display time.

2. Fixed bug where scope form cursors would show the wrong values in impedance mode.
3. Fixed bug that prevented the normal trigger from working in impedance mode on the scope form.
4. Fixed bug in AD2 impedance mode on the scope form that stopped the scope after a temperature measurement.
5. Fixed bug where the cursors could show values in atto seconds instead of zero due to rounding error.
6. Added a minimum current level in the current waveform for impedance measurements to overcome the offset of the amplifiers.
